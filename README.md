**Description:** Team Management module is an OpenMRS module that extends OpenMRS to allow management of multiple teams of a project. It allows users to add/edit/delete team role, team and team members. Each team hierarchy can own any team, team has only one supervisor. User can easily transfer member to another team/team hierarchy, make a new team supervisor, make new team hierarchy supervisor (which itself would be another team hierarchy), view team hierarchy/members/teams, view team hierarchy/team/team members history.
